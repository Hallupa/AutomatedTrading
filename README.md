5. Ability to view trades on a candle chart
6. Show statistics such as expectancy, drawdown, etc
7. Ability to download candle data from FXCM

9. Add machine learning support

## Progress so far
From the project aims, I have everything above 1-9 done in a basic form. Below are screenshots of progress so far. This is still highly experimental.
